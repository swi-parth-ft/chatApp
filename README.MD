JWT_EXPIRE=2d
COOKIE_EXPIRE=2
NODE_ENV=production
CLOUDINARY_NAME=xxxx

 1. Build the frontend by running the following command in the frontend directory: `npm run build`
 2.  Add the following deployment code to the `app.js` file in the backend directory:  
 

 ```javascript 
  // -----deployment code----- 

const path = require("path");
const __dirname1 = path.resolve(); 
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname1, "/frontend/build"))); 
   app.get("*", (req, res) => res.sendFile( path.resolve(__dirname1, "frontend", "build", "index.html") ) );

 }
 else {

  app.get("/", (req, res) => { res.send("API is running..");

   }); 
   }

  // -----deployment code ends-----
  ```
3 Push the code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
4 Sign up for Render and select "Web Services" from the dashboard.
5 Choose the repository from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
